# trip-expense-calculator
This is a calculator that will split up expenses evenly among individuals to efficiently reimburse a purchaser. My friends and I faced a problem on our spring break hiking trip â€“ how could we easily keep track of who pays what, using a more sophisticated method than slapping receipts on the fridge? Et voila! Fill in a spreadsheet in the given format, export to .csv, feed it to the Python script, and the calculator will spit out a concise, readable output detailing precisely who owes what to whom plus who is owed what by whom.

For this repository, I filled in the spreadsheet with some hypothetical friends' expenses on a trip to outer space.
